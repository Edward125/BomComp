!   AGILENT ICT STANDARD TESTMAIN      Revision: "Agilent i3070 07.20p 0808 WN"
!   PANELIZATION VERSION
!##############################################################################
!   This "main" program sequences execution of testplan subroutines and
!   assumes that the current working directory is already set to the
!   appropriate board directory.
!   This testmain has included the code to support the following optional
!   features:
!        Data Logging for PushButton QSTATS, QSTATS-II and ART
!        Chek-Point (pin tests)
!        Boundary Scan: Interconnect Plus & ScanWorks
!        Panelized Boards
!        Agilent Intelligent Yield Enhancement Test (IYET)
!        Agilent Worst Probe Report (WPR)
!        Agilent First Pass Yield (FPY)
!   Once the testplan is working, you may selectively enable
!   any combination of the features by changing the 'flag' variables
!   in the subroutine "Set_Custom_Options".  Use the following command:
!         find  "!   Other"&" parameters"  ! takes you to option settings
!
!   Turn learn on and run the testplan on a known good board.  After the
!   learning run is successfully completed, the testplan is ready for
!   customization, debug and production testing.
!   Analog limits are logged by standard testmain if and only if the
!   learn flag is on.  Limits must be logged once each time they change
!   in order for PushButton Q-STATS or Q-STATS II to produce histograms.
!
!   If flash is to be programmed on this board, the testplan needs to have the
!   locations marked !flash! modified or reviewed.  Please review the flash
!   manual for full explanation. Key elements include:
!
!   full disabling of buses and upstream control lines is required for safety
!   use ID check for digital test subroutine to ensure proper part placement
!   Cycle power if required to three-state upstream devices

sub Reset_Board
   !---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ! This 'pause' section is placed here to remind the test programmer
   ! that some powered tests may depend upon the TCK/TMS signals of
   ! boundary scan chains/devices being held in a stable state.
   ! When the testplan is run, the tests are properly sequenced
   ! to assure that the disabled state is set; however, board level
   ! circuitry may interfere with the persistence of the disabled state.
   ! You may need to take additional measures; for example, you may
   ! place your own pullup/down resistor in the fixture to assure a
   ! stable TMS and/or TCK, or utilize a GP relay to disable some TCK
   ! oscillator, etc.
   ! For further explanation, see the Boundary-Scan Manual for the
   ! section titled 'Maintaining Persistence of Boundary-Scan Disables'.
   !
   !---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ! When Boundary-Scan tests are complete, you may need to produce
   ! a hard reset on the board-under-test to bring the ICs back into
   ! operational mode.  One way of doing this is to cycle power to the
   ! board using the following call:

   call Cycle_Power_On_Board ! Cycle Power to reset digital state of board
   ! call ScanWorks_Pretest    ! Configure volatile devices, if needed

   ! Power cycling is time consuming and may not be necessary.  Some boards
   ! may not need any resetting.  Others may have a digital reset node
   ! you can toggle with a digital test to reset the board.
   !
   ! When you have evaluated the needs of this board and modified this
   ! section, remove the pause and these comments.  You should take care
   ! to document the action you have taken for future reference.

! This 'pause' section is placed here to remind the test programmer
! that the Boundary-Scan disable tests depend upon their respective
! TCK/TMS signals being held in a stable state while other testing
! is done.  This assures that the disabled state of the Boundary-Scan
! chain is not accidentally lost.  Board level circuitry may
! interfere with the persistance of the disabled state.  You may
! need to take additional measures;  for example, you may place your
! own pullup/down resistor in the fixture to assure a stable TMS
! and/or TCK, or utilize a GP relay to disable some TCK oscillator, etc.
! For further explanation, see the Boundary-Scan Manual for the
! section titled 'Maintaining Persistance of Boundary-Scan Disables'.
!
! When you have assured persistance of the disable state, you should
! comment out the print/pause statements above.  It would also be a
! good idea to briefly document here the measures you may have taken
! (if any were needed) to assure persistance of the disables.
